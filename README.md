**Startup Weekend Project** 

This project was created for the Spartenburg Startup Weekend. Startup Weekend <http://startupweekend.org/> is basically a competition where the end goal is to create a viable startup. At the end of the weekend, each startup group then pitches to a group of judges (who are usually startup entrepreneurs themselves) for a chance to win (often receiving prizes designed to aid the startup idea). This was an exciting project to be a part of and was all the more rewarding as our team won the competition. 

###Our Startup Idea
Our group was trying to create a prototype for an app that would help children learn to read by combining an industry standard book format for young readers with personalization. The prototype was to demonstrate an easy to use interface that allowed parents to add their child's name and pictures to a story. The end product was a personalized story in pdf form which could be printed or viewed electronically. 

###My Role On The Team
####Created Splash Page
I created this splash page (design & code) which hooked up to our group's Facebook page and Mailchimp account. The purpose of this was to help demonstrate the market interest for this project. Per the constraints of the weekend, this had to be completed quickly so we could promote it and get some momentum in order to show consumer interest. With a little help I was also able to link our project leader's domain to this project on GitHub's hosting. 

####Assisted w/Programming on the Prototype Itself
I also helped with the coding on the prototype itself along with Joshua (<https://github.com/joshuamaxwell>), a fellow Iron Yard classmate. I mostly handled any coding emergencies that came up so that Joshua could continue to make progress, so I wasn't as involved with this aspect of the project. The goal of the weekend was to get a protype that could convey the idea, not necessarily a prototype that was usable to the fullest extent. We made a lot of progress on the working prototype, but in the end had to abondon actual functionality for the appearance of functionality. The prototype (which was designed for mobile use only) can be viewed here: <http://joshuamaxwell.github.io/e-book>
